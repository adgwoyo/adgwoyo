- 👋 Hi, I’m @adgwoyo
- 👀 I’m interested in softwre development, automation and cloud computing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to automate systems/application deployment and management using Ansible. I will also be learning about docker, kubernetes and OpenShift soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on playbooks that manage an entire datacenter infrastructure with little to no human effort.
